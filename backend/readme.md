## 🔍 Problem It Solves

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Upload Receipt**: Users upload a receipt as an image or PDF.
2. **OCR Processing**: The server extracts text using **Tesseract.js**, a JavaScript OCR engine.
3. **Data Parsing**: Extracted text is parsed to identify important fields like:
   - Vendor name
   - Date of purchase
   - Total amount
   - Line items (optional)
4. **Structured Output**: Clean, structured data is returned for use in apps, dashboards, or reports.
